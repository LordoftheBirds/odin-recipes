First project to put my HTML knowledge into practice
This will be a very basic recipe website built using what HTML knowledge I've learned so far
In this project I used my knowledge of HTML so far, including: How to make a boilerplate HTML template from scratch, 
the use of a few html elements(primarily headers and paragraphs), how to make and use lists(ordered and unordered), 
how to use relative hyperlinks, and how to added images to a website, including using alt text. Using this knowledge, 
I created a very bare bones recipe website.
